## Summar
Takes the most recent data from the COVID data source and displays it in a table, sorted based on names. The data is then displayed in the OpenLayers map using a geojson file with country borders and colors based on whether data requested is total recovered, infected, or dead. The table can be sorted by clicking the column headings and the data displayed on the map can be changed based on the buttons pressed.
